# Fusion+ Penetration Test Program
The year is 2047, and you have been paid by the mega corporation Fusion+ to perform a security audit of their Toyota building. This means walking into the building and trying to get access to top secret information – a designated button in Mr. Toyota’s office is your target. You wander around, collecting items for a janitor costume. When you are done, you enter Mr. Toyota’s office and grab the red “flag” button, failing the company on the security audit.

This button is your villain.
